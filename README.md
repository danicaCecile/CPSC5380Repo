# CPSC5380Repo
A repository for my web stack course CPSC 5380.

To run on development server:

2. navigate to conFusion file (this should be the file the repo is in, so no navigation could be needed)
3. type npm start

submitting this repo for assignment 1. font awesome was giving 404 error when i was running in the devlopment server and i could not figure out why in time for submission, so icons and fonts are missing. appologies. i think i covered everything the assignment asked for but i may have misinturpreted. i added some bootstrap css such as images, navbar, breadcrumbs, (and icons if font awesome would work :/ ) i added all of the java script components to the aboutus.html page.
